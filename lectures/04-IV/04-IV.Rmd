# Where Are We At?

.pull-left[

## What Did we Do Last Week?

* We introduced the `data.table` package.

* We compared it the `dplyr` approach.

* We highlighted pros and cons and the potential for using them both.

]


--

.pull-right[

## Today

* we will introduce *instrumental variables* (IV)

* We will look at a historic episode from 1850 London.

* We will introduce the IV estimator formally.
]

# Setting the Scene

.pull-left[

* In chapters [7](https://scpoecon.github.io/ScPoEconometrics/causality.html), [8](https://scpoecon.github.io/ScPoEconometrics/STAR.html) and [9](https://scpoecon.github.io/ScPoEconometrics/RDD.html) of the book (and the intro course) we talk about the merits of _experimental methods_.

* Randomized Control Trials (RCTs) or _Quasiexperimental_ (as good as random) settings allow us to estimate **causal** effects. 

* In particular the [RCT](https://scpoecon.github.io/ScPoEconometrics/causality.html#rct) should be familiar to you.

]

--

.pull-right[

* If people have some sort of control about getting treatment, there will be *selection*.

* RCTs can break the self-selection of people into treatment by assigning randomly.

* So with experimental data, we have good solution.

* What about non-experimental data?

# John Snow's (Non) Experiment

.pull-left[

* John Snow was a physician in London around 1850, when Cholera erupted several times in the City.

* There was a dispute at the time about how the disease is transmitted: via air or via water?

]

--

.pull-right[

## 1850

* Unknown that germs can cause disease.
* Microscopes exist, but work at rather poor resolution.
* Most human pathogens are not visible to the naked eye.
* The so-called *infection theory* (i.e. infection via *germs*) has some supporters, 
* but the dominant idea is that disease, in general, results from [*miasmas*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miasma_theory)

# Snow's Detective Work

.pull-left[

* Snow collected a lot of data.

* He first mapped the location of dead during the 1854 outbreak.

* This was the notorious *Broadstreet Pump Outbreak*

]

.pull-right[
```{r snow-map,echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("../../img/snow-map.jpg")
```
]

---

# The `cholera` package

.pull-left[
* The `cholera` package has some interesting features.

* For example an R version of Snow's map:
]

.pull-right[
```{r}
cholera::snowMap()
```
]


---

# Removal of the Broad Street Pump?

.pull-left[
* Snow identified the Broad Street Pump as culprit.

* He pleaded to have its handle removed.

* He was sceptical this was the reason the epidemic ended.

]

.pull-right[
```{r,echo = FALSE}
plot(cholera::timeSeries())
```
]

# Mapping London's Water Supply


* Water supply came from the River Thames

* Different supply companies had different intake points

* Southwark and Vauxhall water companies took in water beneath a major sewage discharge.

* Lambeth water did not.



---

# Snow's conclusion

* Snow collected the followign data: 

```{r,echo = FALSE}
st9 <- data.frame(area = c("Southwark and Vauxhall","Lambeth","Rest of London"),numhouses = c(40046,26107,256423), 
                  deaths = c(1263,98,1422),
                   death1000 = c(315,37,59))
knitr::kable(st9)
```

* And concluded

>that if Southwark and Vauxhall water companies had moved their water intakes upstream to where Lambeth water was taking in their supply, roughly 1,000 lives could have been saved. 

* For proponents of the miasma theory, this was still not evidence enough, because there were also many factors that led to poor air quality in those areas.
