# Binary Response Models

.pull-left[

So far, our models looked like this:

$$\begin{align}
y &= b_0 + b_1 x + e \\
e &\sim N\left(0,\sigma^2\right)
\end{align}$$

* The distributional assumption on $e$: 

* In priniciple implies that $y \in \mathbb{R}$.

* test scores, earnings, crime rates etc are all continuous outcomes. ‚úÖ

]

--

.pull-right[

But some outcomes are clearly binary (i.e. either `TRUE` or `FALSE`):

* You either work or you don't,

* You either have children or you don't,

* You either bought a product or you didn't,

* You flipped a coin and it came up either heads or tails.

]

---

# Binary Outcomes

* Outcomes restricted to `FALSE` vs `TRUE`, or `0` vs `1`. 

* We'd have $y \in  \{0,1\}$. 

* In those situations we are primarily interested in estimating the **response probability** or the **probability of success**:

$$p(x) = \Pr(y=1 | x)$$
* how does $p(x)$ change as we change $x$?

* we ask 
    >If we increase $x$ by one unit, how would the probability of $y=1$ change?

# Remembering Bernoulli Fun

.pull-left[
Remember the [Bernoulli Distribution?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernoulli_distribution): We call a random variable $y \in \{0,1\}$ such that

$$\begin{align}
\Pr(y = 1) &= p \\
\Pr(y = 0) &= 1-p \\
p &\in[0,1]
\end{align}$$

a *Bernoulli* random variable. 
]

.pull-right[
For us: *condition* those probabilities on a covariate $x$

$$\begin{align}
\Pr(y = 1 | X = x) &= p(x) \\
\Pr(y = 0 | X = x) &= 1-p(x) \\
p(x) &\in[0,1]
\end{align}$$

* Partcularly: *expected value* (i.e. the average) of $Y$ given $x$

$$
E[y | x] = p(x) \times 1 + (1-p(x)) \times 0 = p(x)
$$

* We often model **conditional expectations** üòâ
]

---

# The Linear Probability Model (LPM)

* The simplest option. Model the response probability as

$$
\Pr(y = 1 | x) = p(x) = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_1 + \dots + \beta_K x_K
$$
* Interpretation: *a 1 unit change in $x_1$, say, results in a change of $p(x)$ of $\beta_1$.*

## Example: Mroz (1987)

* Female labor market participation

* How does `inlf` (*in labor force*) status depend on non-wife household income, her education, age and number of small children?


---

# Mroz 1987

```{r,fig.height = 4}
data(mroz, package = "wooldridge")
plot(factor(inlf) ~ age, data = mroz, 
     ylevels = 2:1,
     ylab = "in labor force?")

* **identical** to our previous linear regression models

* Just `inlf` takes on only two values, 0 or 1. 

* Results: non-wife income increases by 10 (i.e 10,000 USD), $p(x)$ falls by 0.034 (that's a small effect!), 

* an additional small child would reduce the probability of work by 0.26 (that's large).

# Task 2 (10 Minutes): Saturated LPM

Define a *saturated* LPM as before

$$
\Pr(y = 1 | x) = p(x) = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_1 + \dots + \beta_K x_K
$$
but restrict all $x_j \in \{0,1\}$.

1. Create a binary indicator `age_lt_50 = 1` for age smaller than 50 and `0` else and same for `husage_lt_50`. 

1. Run a full interactions model (use the `*` syntax in your formula) of `age_lt_50 = 1` interacted with `husage_lt_50`. I.e. run the following LPM: 
$$
\Pr(y = 1 | x) =\beta_0 + \beta_1 \text{age_lt_50} + \beta_2 \text{husage_lt_50} + \beta_3 \times \text{age_lt_50} \times \text{husage_lt_50}
$$

1. `predict` $\Pr(y = 1 | x)$ for each observation using your LPM.

1. What's the probability for a woman younger than 50 with a husband younger than 50?

1. make a plot similar to the one on the previous slide.

# Nonlinear Binary Response Models

In this class of models we change the way we model the response probability $p(x)$. Instead of the simple linear structure from above, we write

$$
\Pr(y = 1 | x) = p(x) = G \left(\beta_0 + \beta_1 x_1 + \dots + \beta_K x_K \right)
$$
* *almost* identical to LPM!

* except the *linear index* $\beta_0 + \beta_1 x_1 + \dots + \beta_K x_K$ is now inside some function $G(\cdot)$. 

* Main property of $G$: transforms any $z\in \mathbb{R}$ into a number in the interval $(0,1)$. 

* This immediately solves our problem of getting weird predictions for probabilities.

# $G$: **probit** and **logit**

.left-wide[
```{r cdfs,echo = FALSE,fig.height = 5}
ggplot(data.frame(x = c(-5,5)), aes(x=x)) + 
  stat_function(fun = pnorm, aes(colour = "Probit"), size = 1) + 
  stat_function(fun = plogis, aes(colour = "Logit"), size = 1) + 
  theme_bw() + 
  scale_colour_manual(name = "Function G",values = c("red", "blue")) +
  scale_y_continuous(name = "Pr(y = 1 | x)")
```
]

.right-thin[

<br>
For both **probit** and **logit** we see that:

1. any value $x$ results in a value $p(x)$ between 0 and 1

1. the higher $x$, the higher the resulting $p(x)$.

1. Logit has *fatter tails* than Probit.

# Running probit and logit in `R`: the `glm` function

* We use the `glm` function to run a **generalized linear model**

* This *generalizes* our standard linear model. We have to specify a `family` and a `link`:

```{r}
probit <- glm(inlf ~ age, 
                    data = mroz, 
                    family = binomial(link = "probit"))

logit <- glm(inlf ~ age, 
                    data = mroz, 
                    family = binomial(link = "logit"))

```

---

# Interpretation

.pull-left[
```{r}
modelsummary::modelsummary(list("probit" = probit,"logit" = logit))
```
]

.pull-right[
* probit coefficient for `age` is `r round(coef(probit)[2],3)` 

* logit: `r round(coef(logit)[2],3)` for logit, 

* impact of age on the prob of working is **negative**

* However, **how** negative? We can't tell!
]

---

# Interpretation

The model is

$$
\Pr(y = 1 | \text{age})= G \left(x \beta\right) = G \left(\beta_0 + \beta_1 \text{age} \right) 
$$
and the *marginal effect* of `age` on the response probability is

$$\frac{\partial{\Pr(y = 1 | \text{age})}}{ \partial{\text{age}}} = g \left(\beta_0 + \beta_1 \text{age} \right) \beta_1$$

* function $g$ is defined as $g(z) = \frac{dG}{dz}(z)$ - the first derivative function of $G$ (i.e. the *slope* of $G$). 

* given $G$ that is nonlinear, this means that $g$ will be non-constant. You are able to try this out yourself using this [app here](https://floswald.shinyapps.io/marginal_effects_of_logit_probit/):

```{r, eval = FALSE}
ScPoApps::launchApp("marginal_effects_of_logit_probit")
```

or online 

---

# Interpretation

So you can see that there is not one single *marginal effect* in those models, as that depends on *where we evaluate* the previous expression. In practice, there are two common approaches:

1. report effect at the average values of $x$:             $$g(\bar{x} \beta) \beta_j$$

1. report the sample average of all marginal effects: $$\frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^N g(x_i \beta) \beta_j$$

Thankfully there are packages available that help us to compute those marginal effects fairly easily. One of them is called [`mfx`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/mfx/), and we would use it as follows:

---

# Interpretation

```{r glms}
f <- "inlf ~ age + kidslt6 + nwifeinc" # setup a formula
glms <- list()
glms$probit <- glm(formula = f, 
                    data = mroz, 
                    family = binomial(link = "probit"))
glms$logit <- glm(formula = f, 
                    data = mroz, 
                    family = binomial(link = "logit"))
# now the marginal effects versions
glms$probitMean <- mfx::probitmfx(formula = f, 
                    data = mroz, atmean = TRUE)
glms$probitAvg <- mfx::probitmfx(formula = f, 
                    data = mroz, atmean = FALSE)
glms$logitMean <- mfx::logitmfx(formula = f, 
                    data = mroz, atmean = TRUE)
glms$logitAvg <- mfx::logitmfx(formula = f, 
                    data = mroz, atmean = FALSE)

```

# Interpretation

modelsummary::modelsummary(glms, 
                           stars = TRUE,
                           gof_omit = "AIC|BIC")

# Goodness of Fit in Binary Models

# GOF in Binary Models

* There is no universally accepted $R^2$ for binary models.

* We can think of a *pseudo* $R^2$ which compares our model to one without any regressors:

```{r}
glms$probit0 <- update(glms$probit, formula = . ~ 1)  # intercept model only
1 - as.vector(logLik(glms$probit)/logLik(glms$probit0))
```

--

* But that's not super informative (unlike the standard $R^2$). Changes in likelihood value are highly non-linear, so that's not great.

* Let's check **accuracy** - what's the proportion correctly predicted! `round(fitted(x))` assigns `1` if the predicted prob $> 0.5$.

```{r}
prop.table(table(true = mroz$inlf, pred = round(fitted(glms$probit))))
```

---

# GOF in Binary Models: ROC Curves

* The 0.5 cutuff is arbitrary. What if all predicted probs are $> 0.5$ but in the data there are about 50% of zeros? 

* Let's choose an *arbitrary cutoff* $c \in (0,1)$ and check accuracy for each value. This gives a better overview.

--

* Also, we can confront the **true positives rate** (TPR) with the **false positives rate** (FPR). 
    1. TPR: number of women correctly predicted to work divided by num of working women.
    2. FPR: number of women incorrectly predicted to work divided by num of non-working women.
    
--
    
* Plotting FPR vs TPR for each $c$ defines the **ROC** (Receiver Operating Characteristics) Curve.

* A good model has a ROC curve in the upper left corner: FPR = 0, TPR = 1.

---

# GOF in Binary Models: ROC Curves

```{r,fig.height = 3}

# Task 3 (10 Minutes): `SwissLabor`

1. Load the `SwissLabor` Dataset from the `AER` package with `data(SwissLabor, package = "AER")`

1. `skim` the data to get a quick overview. How many foreigners are in the data?

1. Run a probit model of `participation` on all other variables plus age squared. Which age has the largest impact on participation? 

1. What is the marginal effect at the mean of all $x$ of being a foreigner on participation?

1. Produce a ROC curve of this probit model and discuss it!
