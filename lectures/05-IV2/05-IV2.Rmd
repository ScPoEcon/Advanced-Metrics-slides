## What Did we Do Last Week?

* We learned about John Snow's grand experiment in London 1850.

* We used his story to motivate the IV estimator.

* You took a quiz about some IV aspects.

.pull-right[

## Today

* We'll look at further IV applications.

* We introduce an extension called *Two Stage Least Squares*.

* We will use `R` to compute the estimates.

# AK91 Estimation: Two Stage Least Squares (2SLS)

AK91 allow us to introduce a widely used variation of our simple IV estimator: **2SLS**

1. We estimate a **first stage model** which uses only exogenous variables (like $z$) to explain our endgenous regressor $s$.

2. We then use the first stage model to *predict* values of $s$ in what is called the **second stage** or the **reduced form** model. Performing this procedure is supposed to take out any impact of $A$ in the correlation we observe in our data between $s$ and $y$.

\begin{align}
\text{1. Stage: }s_i &= \alpha_0 + \alpha_1 z_i + \eta_i \\ 
\text{2. Stage: }y_i &= \beta_0 + \beta_1 \hat{s}_i + u_i 
\end{align}

**Conditions:**

1. Relevance of the IV: $\alpha_1 \neq 0$
1. Independence (IV assignment as good as random): $E[\eta | z] = 0$
1. Exogeneity (our exclusion restriction): $E[u | z] = 0$

# IV Identification

Let's go back to our simple linear model:

$$
y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x + u
$$

where we fear that $Cov(x,u) \neq 0$, $x$ is *endogenous*.

## Conditions for IV

1. **first stage** or **relevance**: $Cov(z,x) \neq 0$
2. **IV exogeneity**: $Cov(z,u) = 0$: the IV is exogenous in the outcome equation.

# IV Identification



\begin{align}
Cov(z,y) &= Cov(z, \beta_0 + \beta_1 x + u) \\
         &= \beta_1 Cov(z,x) + Cov(z,u) 
\end{align}

.pull-left[
Under condition 2. above (*IV exogeneity*), we have $Cov(z,u)=0$, hence

$$
Cov(z,y) = \beta_1 Cov(z,x) 
$$
]

.pull-right[
and under condition 1. (*relevance*), we have $Cov(z,x)\neq0$, so that we can divide the equation through to obtain

$$
\beta_1 =  \frac{Cov(z,y)}{Cov(z,x)}.
$$
* $\beta_1$ is *identified* via population moments $Cov(z,y)$ and $Cov(z,x)$. 

* We can *estimate* those moments via their *sample analogs*

# IV Estimator

Just plugging in for the population moments:

$$\hat{\beta}_1 = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^n (z_i - \bar{z})(y_i - \bar{y})}{\sum_{i=1}^n (z_i - \bar{z})(x_i - \bar{x})}$$

* The intercept estimate is $\hat{\beta}_0 = \bar{y} - \hat{\beta}_1 \bar{x}$ 

--

* Given both assumptions 1. and 2. are satisfied, we say that *the IV estimator is consistent for $\beta_1$*. We write

$$
\text{plim}(\hat{\beta}_1) = \beta_1
$$

in words: the *probability limit* of $\hat{\beta}_1$ is the true $\beta_1$. 

* If this is true, we say that this estimator is **consistent**.

---

# IV Inference

Assuming $E(u^2|z) = \sigma^2$ the variance of the IV slope estimator is

$$Var(\hat{\beta}_{1,IV}) = \frac{\sigma^2}{n \sigma_x^2 \rho_{x,z}^2}$$

* $\sigma_x^2$ is the population variance of $x$, 

* $\sigma^2$ the one of $u$, and  

* $\rho_{x,z}$ is the population correlation between $x$ and $z$.

--

You can see 2 important things here:

1. Without the term $\rho_{x,z}^2$, this is **like OLS variance**.
2. As sample size $n$ increases, the **variance decreases**.

---

# IV Variance is Always Larger than OLS Variance

* Replace $\rho_{x,z}^2$ with $R_{x,z}^2$, i.e. the R-squared of a regression of $x$ on $z$:

$$Var(\hat{\beta}_{1,IV}) = \frac{\sigma^2}{n \sigma_x^2 R_{x,z}^2}$$

1. Given $R_{x,z}^2 < 1$ in most real life situations, we have that $Var(\hat{\beta}_{1,IV}) > Var(\hat{\beta}_{1,OLS})$ almost certainly.

--

1. The higher the correlation between $z$ and $x$, the closer their $R_{x,z}^2$ is to 1. With $R_{x,z}^2 = 1$ we get back to the OLS variance. This is no surprise, because that implies that in fact $z = x$.

So, if you have a valid, exogenous regressor $x$, you should *not* perform IV estimation using $z$ to obtain $\hat{\beta}$, since your variance will be unnecessarily large.

# Returns to Education for Married Women

Consider the following model for married women's wages:

$$
\log wage = \beta_0 + \beta_1 educ + u
$$
Let's run an OLS on this, and then compare it to an IV estimate using *father's education*. Keep in mind that this is a valid IV $z$ if 

1. *fatheduc* and *educ* are correlated
2. *fatheduc* and $u$ are not correlated.

# IV with a Weak Instrument

* IV is consistent under given assumptions.

* However, *even if* we have only very small $Cor(z,u)$, we can get wrong-footed

* Small corrleation between $x$ and $z$ can produce **inconsistent** estimates.

$$
\text{plim}(\hat{\beta}_{1,IV}) = \beta_1 + \frac{Cor(z,u)}{Cor(z,x)} \cdot \frac{\sigma_u}{\sigma_x}
$$
]

--

.pull-right[
* Take $Cor(z,u)$ is very small,
* A **weak instrument** is one with only a small absolute value for $Cor(z,x)$ 
* This will blow up this second term in the probability limit. 
* Even with a very big sample size $n$, our estimator would *not* converge to the true population parameter $\beta_1$, because we are using a weak instrument.

# Weak Stuff

To illustrate this point, let's assume we want to look at the impact of number of packs of cigarettes smoked per day by pregnant women (*packs*) on the birthweight of their child (*bwght*):

$$
\log(bwght) = \beta_0 + \beta_1 packs + u
$$

We are worried that smoking behavior is correlated with a range of other health-related variables which are in $u$ and which could impact the birthweight of the child. So we look for an IV. Suppose we use the price of cigarettes (*cigprice*), assuming that the price of cigarettes is uncorrelated with factors in $u$. Let's run the first stage of *cigprice* on *packs* and then let's show the 2SLS estimates:


---

# Weak Stuff


```{r bw}
data(bwght, package = "wooldridge")
mods <- list()
mods[["First Stage"]] <- lm(packs ~ cigprice, data = bwght)
mods[["IV"]] <- estimatr::iv_robust(log(bwght) ~  packs | cigprice, data = bwght)
```

```{r,echo = FALSE}
modelsummary(mods, gof_map = gm, 
             gof_omit = gom, output = "huxtable") %>%
  set_bottom_border(row = 7, col = everywhere) %>%
  set_bold(1, everywhere) %>%
  set_tb_padding(5)
```


---

The first column of table \@ref(tab:bw) shows that the first stage is *very* weak. The partial effect of *cigprice* on *packs* smoked is zero! People don't seem to care a great deal about the price of cigarettes (at least in the range of price variation observed in this dataset). The $R^2$ of that first stage is thus zero. What do we get if we use that IV nonetheless in a 2SLS estimation as in column 2? We get a huge coefficient of unexpected sign on *packs* (smoking more increases birthweight? ðŸ¤”), with very large standard error, so statistically speaking, we cannot distinguish this from zero. What is more important, however, is that even if they *were* significant, the estimates of column 2 are **invalid**. The *relevance* of the IV condition is clearly not satisfied, hence, invalid approach.
