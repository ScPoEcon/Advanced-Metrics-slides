## What Did we Do Last Week?

* We learned about John Snow's grand experiment in London 1850.

* We used his story to motivate the IV estimator.

* You took a quiz about some IV aspects.

## Today

* We'll look at further IV applications.

* We introduce an extension called *Two Stage Least Squares*.

* We will use `R` to compute the estimates.

* However, people can drop out of school legally on their 16-th birthday!

# AK91 Estimation: Two Stage Least Squares (2SLS)

AK91 allow us to introduce a widely used variation of our simple IV estimator: **2SLS**

1. We estimate a **first stage model** which uses only exogenous variables (like $z$) to explain our endgenous regressor $s$.

2. We then use the first stage model to *predict* values of $s$ in what is called the **second stage** or the **reduced form** model. Performing this procedure is supposed to take out any impact of $A$ in the correlation we observe in our data between $s$ and $y$.

\begin{align}
\text{1. Stage: }s_i &= \alpha_0 + \alpha_1 z_i + \eta_i \\ 
\text{2. Stage: }y_i &= \beta_0 + \beta_1 \hat{s}_i + u_i 
\end{align}

**Conditions:**

1. Relevance of the IV: $\alpha_1 \neq 0$
1. Independence (IV assignment as good as random): $E[\eta | z] = 0$
1. Exogeneity (our exclusion restriction): $E[u | z] = 0$

# Remember the F-Statistic?

* We encountered this before: it's useful to test restricted vs unrestricted models against each other.

--

* Here, we are interested whether our instruments are *jointly* significant. Of course, with only one IV, that's not more informative than the t-stat of that IV.

--

* This F-Stat compares the predictive power of the first stage with and without the IVs. If they have very similar predictive power, the F-stat will be low, and we will not be able to reject the H0 that our IVs are **jointly insignificant** in the first stage model. 😞

1. Plot of first stage and high F-stat offer compelling evidence for **relevance**. ✅

2. Is QOB **independent** of, say, *maternal characteristics*? Birthdays are not really random - there are birth seasons for certain socioeconomic backgrounds. highest maternal schooling give birth in second quarter. (not in 4th! ✅)

3. Exclusion: What if the youngest kids (born in Q4!) are the disadvantaged ones early on, which has long-term negative impacts? That would mean $E[u|z] \neq 0$! Well, with QOB the youngest ones actually do better (more schooling and higher wage)! ✅

# Mechanics of IV

## Identification and Inference

# IV Identification

Let's go back to our simple linear model:

$$
y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x + u
$$

where we fear that $Cov(x,u) \neq 0$, $x$ is *endogenous*.

## Conditions for IV

1. **first stage** or **relevance**: $Cov(z,x) \neq 0$
2. **IV exogeneity**: $Cov(z,u) = 0$: the IV is exogenous in the outcome equation.

---

# Valid Model (A) vs Invalid Model (B) for IV `z`

    y = c(z = 0, x = 0, u = 0.5, y = 0)
    )

dag1 <- dagify(y ~ x + u,
              x ~ z + u, coords = coords)

\begin{align}

and under condition 1. (**relevance**), we have $Cov(z,x)\neq0$, so that we can divide the equation through to obtain

$$
* $\beta_1$ is *identified* via population moments $Cov(z,y)$ and $Cov(z,x)$.

]

# IV Estimator

Just plugging in for the population moments:

$$\hat{\beta}_1 = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^n (z_i - \bar{z})(y_i - \bar{y})}{\sum_{i=1}^n (z_i - \bar{z})(x_i - \bar{x})}$$

* The intercept estimate is $\hat{\beta}_0 = \bar{y} - \hat{\beta}_1 \bar{x}$ 

--

* Given both assumptions 1. and 2. are satisfied, we say that *the IV estimator is consistent for $\beta_1$*. We write

$$
\text{plim}(\hat{\beta}_1) = \beta_1
$$

in words: the *probability limit* of $\hat{\beta}_1$ is the true $\beta_1$. 

* If this is true, we say that this estimator is **consistent**.

---

# IV Inference

Assuming $E(u^2|z) = \sigma^2$ the variance of the IV slope estimator is

$$Var(\hat{\beta}_{1,IV}) = \frac{\sigma^2}{n \sigma_x^2 \rho_{x,z}^2}$$

* $\sigma_x^2$ is the population variance of $x$, 

* $\sigma^2$ the one of $u$, and  

* $\rho_{x,z}$ is the population correlation between $x$ and $z$.

--

You can see 2 important things here:

1. Without the term $\rho_{x,z}^2$, this is **like OLS variance**.
2. As sample size $n$ increases, the **variance decreases**.

---

# IV Variance is Always Larger than OLS Variance

* Replace $\rho_{x,z}^2$ with $R_{x,z}^2$, i.e. the R-squared of a regression of $x$ on $z$:

$$Var(\hat{\beta}_{1,IV}) = \frac{\sigma^2}{n \sigma_x^2 R_{x,z}^2}$$

1. Given $R_{x,z}^2 < 1$ in most real life situations, we have that $Var(\hat{\beta}_{1,IV}) > Var(\hat{\beta}_{1,OLS})$ almost certainly.

--

1. The higher the correlation between $z$ and $x$, the closer their $R_{x,z}^2$ is to 1. With $R_{x,z}^2 = 1$ we get back to the OLS variance. This is no surprise, because that implies that in fact $z = x$.

So, if you have a valid, exogenous regressor $x$, you should *not* perform IV estimation using $z$ to obtain $\hat{\beta}$, since your variance will be unnecessarily large.

# Returns to Education for Married Women

Consider the following model for married women's wages:

$$
\log wage = \beta_0 + \beta_1 educ + u
$$
Let's run an OLS on this, and then compare it to an IV estimate using *father's education*. Keep in mind that this is a valid IV $z$ if 

1. *fatheduc* and *educ* are correlated
2. *fatheduc* and $u$ are not correlated.

# IV with a Weak Instrument

# Weak Stuff

To illustrate this point, let's assume we want to look at the impact of number of packs of cigarettes smoked per day by pregnant women (*packs*) on the birthweight of their child (*bwght*):

$$
\log(bwght) = \beta_0 + \beta_1 packs + u
$$

We are worried that smoking behavior is correlated with a range of other health-related variables which are in $u$ and which could impact the birthweight of the child. So we look for an IV. Suppose we use the price of cigarettes (*cigprice*), assuming that the price of cigarettes is uncorrelated with factors in $u$. Let's run the first stage of *cigprice* on *packs* and then let's show the 2SLS estimates:


---

# Weak Stuff


```{r bw}
data(bwght, package = "wooldridge")
mods <- list()
mods[["First Stage"]] <- lm(packs ~ cigprice, data = bwght)
mods[["IV"]] <- estimatr::iv_robust(log(bwght) ~  packs | cigprice, data = bwght, diagnostics = TRUE)
```

```{r,echo = FALSE}
modelsummary(mods, gof_omit = 'DF|Deviance|AIC|BIC|R2 Adj.|p.value|F$|se_type|statistic|Log.Lik.|Num.Obs.|N|RMSE', output = "huxtable") %>%
  set_bottom_border(row = 7, col = everywhere) %>%
  set_bold(1, everywhere) %>%
  set_tb_padding(5)
```


---

# Weak Stuff

.pull-left[

* The first columns shows: very weak first stage. *cigprice* has zero impact on packs it seems!

* $R^2$ is zero.

* What is we use this IV nevertheless?
]

--

.pull-right[

* in the second column: very large, positive(!) impact of packs smoked on birthweight. 🤔

* Huge Standard Error though.

* An $R^2$ of -23?!

* F-stat of first stage: 0.121. Corresponds to a p-value of `r round(mods[["IV"]]$diagnostic_first_stage_fstatistic["p.value"],3)` : we **cannot** reject the H0 of an insignificant first stage here *at all*.

* So: **invalid** approach. ❌
